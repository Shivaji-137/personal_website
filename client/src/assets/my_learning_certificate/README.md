## These are my learning certificates.

# Note: 
   For Data-driven Astronomy courses in coursera:

       I completed this course during coursera plus free 7-days trial. I am only allowed to get certificate of completion after free trial and one month suscription. 
       However, I could not manage the suscription plus. For that, I have provided a video (DataDriven_astronomy_learning.webm) that provides my proof of completion.
