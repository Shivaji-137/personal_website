Physics students today are fortunate to have a robust ecosystem of Python libraries to support simulations, data analysis, and visualization. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the most essential tools every aspiring physicist should learn.

## ðŸ§® NumPy â€“ Numerical Python

NumPy provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions.

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(np.linalg.inv(a))
